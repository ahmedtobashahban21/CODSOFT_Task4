# Spam SMS Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a Spam SMS Detection project aimed at developing an effective machine learning model to automatically identify and filter out unwanted, unsolicited text messages (spam) from legitimate ones (ham).

## Notebook Content

The project is organized into several sections within the Jupyter Notebook:

### 1.0 - Imports and Load Dataset

- **1.1 - Imports:** This section includes all the necessary Python library imports.
- **1.2 - Load Data:** In this part, we load the SMS dataset that will be used for training and testing the models.

### 2.0 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **2.1 - Visualizing Imbalanced Data:** This section provides insights into the class distribution and visualizes the data's balance between spam and ham messages.

### 3.0 - Preprocessing The Dataset

- **3.1 - Data Preprocessing:** This section covers various data preprocessing operations, such as cleaning, tokenization, and handling missing data.
- **3.2 - Tokens Visualization:** Visual representation of token statistics in the dataset.
- **3.3 - TFIDF Method:** Explanation and implementation of the TF-IDF method for feature extraction.

### 4.0 - Model and Make Predictions

- **4.1 - Model Selection:** Discussion and explanation of the models used for spam SMS detection.
- **4.2 - Naive Bayes Model:** Implementation and evaluation of the Naive Bayes classification model.
- **4.3 - BERT and Evaluate:** The use of BERT for SMS classification, along with performance evaluation.
- **4.4 - FLAN-T5 and Evaluate:** Implementation and evaluation of the FLAN-T5 model for SMS classification.

## How to Use

To replicate or build upon this project, you can follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook sections. Make sure to install the required libraries mentioned in the "Imports" section.
